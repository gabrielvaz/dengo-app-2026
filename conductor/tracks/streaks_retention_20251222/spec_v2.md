## 1. Core Mechanics: The "Dengo Flame"

### 1.1 The Streak Unit
- **Success Action:** Completing at least **1 card swipe** (interaction with the partner).
- **The Visual Metaphor:** The **"Dengo Flame"**. 
  - Days 1-3: Small flickering spark.
  - Days 4-10: Steady blue flame (Hot).
  - Days 11-30: Roaring golden fire (Intense).
  - Days 31+: Cosmic/Purple aura (Soulmates).

### 1.2 Progression System (The Unlocking Loop)
- **Day 0:** 4 Base Categories.
- **Day 7:** Badge "Spark of Interest" + Unlock "Deep Questions".
- **Day 14:** Badge "Steady Connection" + Unlock "Spicy/Intimate".
- **Day 21:** Badge "Emotional Harmony" + Unlock "Future Dreams".
- **Day 30+:** Monthly "Mystery Category" (Unique themes like 'Travel', 'Childhood', 'Values').

### 1.3 The Rescue Mission (Loss Aversion)
- **Trigger:** Streak dies (24h+ since last card).
- **The Mechanic:** On return, the user sees a "Flickering Flame" UI.
- **Rescue Card:** A specific card from the "Forgiveness & Connection" deck: *"What’s one thing you appreciate about us today?"*
- **Outcome:** Answering restores the full streak. Limit: 1 use per week.

## 2. Notification Philosophy: "The Relationship Nudge"

### 2.1 The Voice of Dengo
Inspired by Duolingo but adapted for intimacy:
- **Direct but Sweet:** "Don't leave [Partner Name] hanging."
- **Urgent but Empathetic:** "The flame is low, just 30 seconds of connection can save it."
- **Milestone-centric:** Celebration of time spent together, not just app usage.

### 2.2 Segmented Triggers (The Remanufactured Flows)
- **The "Work Day" Thinking of You (2 PM):** Low-friction engagement. "A quick share can make their afternoon."
- **The "Weekend Ritual" (Fri 8 PM / Sat 10 AM):** High-impact conversion. Leading to deeper categories.
- **The "Loss Aversion" Final Warning (9 PM):** The "Duolingo-style" nudge for the streak.

## 3. Success Metrics (PMM View)
- **Day 7 Retention (D7):** Main target.
- **Share Rate per User:** Metric for the WhatsApp flow.
- **Streak Maintenance:** Percentage of users who use a "Rescue Mission" vs. giving up.
