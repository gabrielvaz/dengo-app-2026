# Product Guidelines

These guidelines define the aesthetic, emotional, and communicative standards for Dengo, ensuring a cohesive experience that aligns with its mission of fostering deep emotional connection.

## 1. Visual Identity & Tone

**Tone:** Elegant & Intimate
- **Aesthetic:** Use deep, rich colors (such as burgundy, navy, and gold) to create a sophisticated environment that feels private and significant.
- **Typography:** Select elegant serif fonts for headers to convey tradition and depth, paired with clean, readable sans-serif fonts for body text.
- **Visual Elements:** Use subtle gradients and soft lighting effects to evoke a sense of intimacy and focused attention.

## 2. Copy & Voice

**Voice:** Poetic & Reflective
- **Language:** The app should speak with grace and thoughtfulness. Use evocative language that invites users to pause and reflect on their emotions and their partner.
- **Notifications:** Alerts should feel like gentle invitations to a sacred ritual of care, rather than digital interruptions. Example: *"The evening is quiet. Shall we find a moment for a Dengo?"*

## 3. Interaction Principles

**Ritualistic Experience:**
- Every interaction should feel intentional. Transitions between flashcards should be smooth and calm, avoiding abrupt animations.
- The interface should minimize distractions, keeping the focus entirely on the content of the cards and the interaction between the couple.

## 4. Gamification & Progression

**Clarity and Motivation:**
- **Feedback:** Use classic gamification elements like clear counters, streaks, and milestone badges to celebrate the couple's consistency.
- **Visual Rewards:** Progression should be clearly visible, providing a sense of achievement in the habit of caring for the relationship.

## 5. Design Ethics

**Privacy First:**
- Since the experience is intimate and locally stored, the design should reinforce a sense of safety and confidentiality.
- **Focus:** The app is a bridge to the partner, not a destination in itself. Encourage putting the phone down once the conversation starts.
