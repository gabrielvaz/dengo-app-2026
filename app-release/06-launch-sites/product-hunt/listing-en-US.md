Daily emotional connection ritual for modern couples

## Description
Dengo transforms caring for your relationship into a light and enjoyable habit. With carefully crafted daily flashcards, the app brings loving couples closer who want to maintain emotional connection even with demanding schedules.

Unlike generic relationship apps or digital therapy, Dengo offers a sustainable 5-minute daily ritual to strengthen your connection. With hundreds of curated questions organized by category (Couples, Soulmates, Deep Questions, Would You Rather, etc.), Dengo adapts to your relationship stage and couple's interests.

The app works offline to protect your privacy and allows you to share meaningful moments without pressure. Dengo is not therapy, but a daily ritual of emotional care - simple enough to be sustainable, but deep enough to create real impact in your relationship.

## First Comment (Maker Update)
Hello Product Hunters! 😊

I'm [PLACEHOLDER - Creator name], creator of Dengo. I'm thrilled to share this tool with you!

Dengo was born from a simple observation: modern couples drift apart emotionally not from lack of love, but from demanding routines and few real conversations. I was tired of seeing couples sitting together, each on their phone, without truly connecting.

After deep research into emotional connection and relationship dynamics, I created Dengo as a light daily ritual - just 5 minutes per day - to strengthen connection between couples. The app offers hundreds of carefully crafted questions, organized by categories and adapted to your relationship stage.

Here are some things that make Dengo special:
- Content curated based on relationship dynamics research
- Light and non-pressured approach (not disguised therapy)
- Works offline to protect your privacy
- Adapted to your relationship stage
- 12+ content categories for every moment

We're just getting started! We plan to add new categories, progress features, and more content based on community feedback.

What do you think? Have you ever felt a lack of emotional connection with your partner? How could Dengo help you?

## First Comment Post (Response to Common Questions)

**About the inspiration:**
Dengo was inspired by research on emotional connection in relationships. Most couples love each other, but with demanding routines and digital distractions, emotional connection gets neglected. Dengo transforms this care into a sustainable daily ritual.

**Differentiation:**
Unlike therapy apps or coaching tools, Dengo is light and sustainable. Just 5 minutes per day with questions that bring you closer, not intensive sessions that become another obligation.

**Privacy:**
We take privacy seriously. The app works offline, your data stays secure, and you have full control over what you share.

**Feedback and evolution:**
We're committed to continuous improvement based on community feedback. We plan to add new categories and features based on real needs of couples.
