App that helps couples maintain emotional connection with 5 minutes per day

### Post Body
Hi r/relationships,

I'm the creator of Dengo, a new app that helps couples maintain emotional connection even with demanding schedules. After deep research into relationship dynamics, I created this as a sustainable daily ritual.

**The Problem:**
Modern couples drift apart emotionally not from lack of love, but from demanding routines and few real conversations. I was tired of seeing couples sitting together, each on their phone, without truly connecting.

**The Solution:**
Dengo offers hundreds of carefully crafted questions, adapted to your relationship stage. Instead of intensive sessions that become another obligation, the app suggests just 5 minutes per day with questions that bring you closer.

**Why it's Different:**
- Light and sustainable approach (not disguised therapy)
- Works offline to protect your privacy
- Adapted to your relationship stage
- 12+ content categories for every moment

The app is available free on the App Store and Play Store. I'm seeking feedback from the community for future improvements. What do you think of this type of approach to maintain emotional connection?

**P.S.** Dengo is not therapy, but a daily ritual of emotional care - simple enough to be sustainable, but deep enough to create real impact in your relationship.

### Initial Comments (for Engagement)

**Comment 1:**
Thanks for the feedback! The therapy concern is valid. Dengo is clear from the start that it's not a substitute for professional counseling. It's a tool for daily connection, like emotional flossing - something light and sustainable that strengthens the relationship over time.

**Comment 2:**
Great point about sustainability! Many relationship apps or practices require large time or emotional commitments, which ends up becoming another obligation. Dengo's focus is exactly on "light and sustainable" - 5 minutes is something any couple can find, even with packed schedules.

**Comment 3:**
About personalization: the app asks about your relationship stage (getting to know each other, dating, married, etc.) and time together (less than 6 months, 2-5 years, etc.). Based on this, it selects more relevant questions for your specific situation.

Building a daily ritual of emotional connection for couples (5 minutes per day)

### Post Body
Hi r/GetMotivated,

I'm sharing a personal project I developed to help couples build a daily ritual of emotional connection: Dengo.

**The Challenge:**
Many couples love each other but find themselves struggling to maintain real, deep conversations with demanding schedules. I decided to approach this like I would create any positive habit - small, sustainable daily steps.

**The System:**
Instead of intensive sessions or weekend workshops, I created a system of 5 minutes per day using carefully crafted questions. It's like emotional flossing - small, daily, with cumulative impact over time.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Small, consistent habits beat intensive, inconsistent plans
- Personalization is crucial - what works for a new couple doesn't necessarily work for a couple married for 10 years
- Privacy and trust are fundamental for emotional discussions

The app is available for free and I'm seeking feedback for improvements. What do you think about applying the same principle of small daily steps to other aspects of life?

### Initial Comments (for Engagement)

**Comment 1:**
Great question! I'm applying the same principle to my own life: small daily actions with cumulative impact. I'm using Dengo with my wife and we've seen a difference in just two weeks. Consistency is really the key factor.

**Comment 2:**
About the science behind it: I based the app on research about relationship dynamics and habit formation. The 5-minute concept is based on studies about the minimum time needed to form a new habit without causing resistance.

App to help couples in long-distance relationships maintain emotional connection

### Post Body
Hi r/longdistance,

As someone in a long-distance relationship myself, I understand the unique challenges you face to maintain emotional connection. This is why I developed Dengo with specific features to support connection despite physical distance.

**LD Features:**
- Questions adapted for couples in different time zones
- Content focused on maintaining intimacy despite distance
- Works offline for connection moments without internet dependency
- Specific categories for overcoming long-distance relationship challenges

**How it can help:**
Instead of relying only on video calls or messages, Dengo provides a framework for deeper, more meaningful conversations. The questions are designed to maintain emotional proximity even when physically distant.

**Questions for the community:**
- What kind of features do you find most valuable for maintaining emotional connection long-distance?
- How do you overcome the challenge of keeping deep conversations going with different schedules?
- Have you used any specific app or method for this?

The app is available for free and I'd love to hear your feedback, especially on how I can make it more useful for LD couples.

### Initial Comments (for Engagement)

**Comment 1:**
Great point about time zones! We're considering implementing a feature that adapts question timing based on each partner's sleep schedules. Would this be useful for you?

**Comment 2:**
About trust and vulnerability: the app is designed to create a safe space for deep conversations. Content is scaled by comfort levels, so you can start with lighter questions and progress as you feel more comfortable.
